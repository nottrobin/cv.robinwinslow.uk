About me
===

I'm an experienced web developer and team leader with wide-ranging expertise and interests. I enjoy finding elegant solutions within complex systems, and I [care deeply](/2013/05/30/why-i-love-the-internet/) about communications technology.

I want to be a part of a progressive and ambitious organisation who truly care about their members and their customers. 

In code, as in life, I like simplicity and I like elegance. I will work maybe a little too hard to find the most elegant solution to a problem. I'm opinionated and I will happily share my opinions in almost any situation.

I like openness. I respect the need for privacy sometimes, but it tends to make me uncomfortable. My ideal company would strive to be as open and transparent as they possible could.

I believe strongly in fostering a no-blame culture, where everyone feels encouraged to give their opinion, and in empowering and respecting all employees. I probably won't fit in well to a company with a steep or rigid hierarchy, or a company that doesn't treat their employees with respect.

When I'm not worrying about society or the internet, I like watching films, playing tennis, chatting with friends or occasionally skiing.
