[IPC Media](http://www.ipcmedia.com ) - January 2011
---

IPC I was a key member of a small team responsible for 4 major brands' large-scale websites. Our team was part of a department comprising over 40 developers. The expertise and experience of the developers at IPC created a wonderful learning environment for me. I learned a huge amount about full-stack development and management of large-scale websites. I became very interested in agile project management strategies, web performance, continuous integration, design patterns and behaviour-driven development. I also gave two presentations on new technologies to the department. 

I maintained and improved countrylife.co.uk, golf-monthly.co.uk, shootinguk.co.uk and horseandhound.co.uk. I extend and debug the PHP Symfony projects and I do front-end development of JavaScript (YUI3 and jQuery) and CSS (including Twitter framework) and I try to champion the use of HTML5 features.

I was a member of a small team working on large projects and ongoing maintenance on ecommerce websites for financial institutions and online retailers.

I worked for Tamar part-time and remotely, doing Perl, HTML, CSS and JavaScript web development on their sites - including Endsleigh.co.uk and Tamar.com.

Following on from my work during my year in industry, I worked full-time for 3 months over the summer. I was working in Perl, JavaScript, CSS and HTML on Tamar's sites.

I led JavaScript development and helped develop a new JavaScript library for them; I adapted and improved their existing bespoke Perl framework and also learned to use Catalyst; I became the premier CSS expert in the department. sites I worked on included endsleigh.co.uk, dreams.co.uk, budgetinsurance.com and tamar.com.
