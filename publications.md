Static Site Generators <small>(presentation)</small>
===

I gave a presentation at Second Wednesday in Nottingham to over 100 people [on the use of Static Site Generators for blog hosting](http://nottrobin.github.io/presentations/static-site-generators.html).

As a precursor to this presentation, Second Wednesday also published [an interview with me](http://secondwednesday.org.uk/robin-winslow.php).

HTML5 and how to use it <small>(presentation)</small>
===

I gave a presentation to the digital department at IPC Media [on HTML5](http://prezi.com/vwrbwbhbwt2m/html5-and-how-to-use-it/).

Let's talk about CSS  <small>(presentation)</small>
===

I gave a presentation to the digital department at IPC Media [about CSS best practice and the potential benefits of CSS preprocessors](http://prezi.com/-eq7oqt-i3cs/lets-talk-about-css/).

Micro-generation schemes <small>(journal paper)</small>
===

Following a piece of coursework I did for my MSc, I collaborated with my supervisors on a journal paper entitled ["Micro-generation schemes: user behaviours and attitudes towards energy consumption"](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139.2012.723140).
